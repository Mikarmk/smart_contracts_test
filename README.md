## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of smart contracts written in Solidity, along with tests to validate their behavior. The goal is to facilitate the development and deployment of secure and efficient smart contracts on blockchain platforms.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes unit tests for all smart contracts.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple installation process to get started quickly.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Clear instructions and examples for using the contracts.
